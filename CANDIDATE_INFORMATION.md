# Candidate Information

Thank you for applying to the Guardian.

Please take some time to go over the [README](./README.md) prior to your interview.
It provides in depth information about this stage: why we perform it, what we’re trying to assess and how.

As an overview, you’ll spend 60 minutes with a software engineer, 
working through **one** of the exercises in this repository. 
You will be writing a program that can be run from the command line.

Your interviewer will tell you which exercise you’ll be working on at the start of the interview.

## Remote Interviews
We conduct remote interviews over [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/).
Google Meet is a video conferencing tool that supports screen sharing.
A link will be included on your interview invitation, click it to join.
Once joined, your interviewer will ask you to share your screen.

Please note, enabling your camera is optional.

### Before the interview
We recommend your coding environment be setup **before** the interview starts.
This is to allow you as much time as possible to demonstrate your skills as we do not assess your IDE setup.

We provide [skeleton projects](https://github.com/guardian/coding-exercise-project) in a few programming languages,
or you can set up an empty project from scratch.

### After the interview
At the end of your interview, you’ll be asked to share your solution with your interviewer for later reference,
ideally as a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/).

This will not be shared outside of the hiring group. 

Thank you and good luck!
